Google Earth Engine script for monitoring NO‚ÇÇ air pollution levels across Ghana (January 2025)


Nitrogen Dioxide (NO‚ÇÇ) Trends over Ghana
A Google Earth Engine Script using Sentinel-5P TROPOMI Data

Overview
This project analyzes atmospheric Nitrogen Dioxide (NO‚ÇÇ) concentration over Ghana using the Sentinel-5P (TROPOMI) dataset.
The script extracts NO‚ÇÇ data, converts it to micromole units, generates a time-series trend chart, and visualizes the spatial distribution for January 2025.

Dataset

Source: COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_NO2
Sensor: Sentinel-5P (TROPOMI)
Variable: NO2_column_number_density
Temporal Coverage: January 1 ‚Äì January 31, 2025
Spatial Coverage: Ghana (using USDOS/LSIB_SIMPLE boundaries)
Methods

Filter dataset by region (Ghana) and date (January 2025).
Convert units from mol/m¬≤ to micromole/m¬≤.
Generate time-series chart of mean NO‚ÇÇ levels over Ghana.
Compute mean spatial distribution of NO‚ÇÇ during the study period.
Visualize results using a custom color palette.
Outputs

Time Series Chart: Daily mean NO‚ÇÇ (micromole/m¬≤) with linear trendline.
Map Visualization: Mean NO‚ÇÇ concentration across Ghana for January 2025.
Why This Matters
Nitrogen Dioxide (NO‚ÇÇ) is a key air pollutant, mainly produced by fossil fuel combustion and industrial activities. Monitoring its trends helps in:

Assessing air quality
Identifying pollution hotspots
Supporting environmental policy and planning
How to Use

Open Google Earth Engine Code Editor.
Copy and paste the script (code) into the editor.
Run the script to visualize results.
